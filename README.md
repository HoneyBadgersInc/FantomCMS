#FantomCMS

FantomCMS is a Web Content Management System developed as a course project for CMPS115 at UC Santa Cruz. We aim to create a functional, modular content management system using the Fantom language that allows for the simple creation of a single-page web application.

Current Developers:
- Jeremy Criquet
- Cole Grim
- Matthew Isaac Lean
- Jono Yang
- Joshua Leihe

#Repository Information

The master branch should always compile into a functional application. Development occurs on branches and is tested before being merged into master. FantomCMS is modular, and as such each module is stored in a "pod" file, which is placed into the lib/fan directory. Each pod should have a specific purpose.

Our program is developed using the Fantom language. As this is a lesser known language, we have opted to include the interpreter in the bin directory. Once compiled, the program can be launched using the fcms executable in the bin directory.

The doc directory contains CMPS115 specific information.
